Multi-line taskbar applet for Cinnamon (Linux Mint)
==============================

This is a clone of the original Cinnamon applet that adds support for a multi-line taskbar.

Installation
------------

1. Download the applet and install to `~/.local/share/cinnamon/applets/`
2. Go to *Menu › Cinnamon Settings › Applets*
3. Ensure applet 'Cinnamon Multi-Line taskbar' is present
4. Uncheck the default 'Cinnamon Window List'
5. Enable applet 'Cinnamon Multi-Line taskbar'
6. Go to *Menu › Cinnamon Settings › Panel*
7. Check 'Use customized panel size'
8. Set bottom height to something around 35-70 pixels (depending on your theme and number of rows for the taskbar)

Configuring the applet
----------------------
While the applet ships with sane default settings, you can adjust them via its
settings GUI:

1. Go to *Menu › Cinnamon Settings › Applets*
2. Right-click *Cinnamon Multi-Line Taskbar*, select *Configure*
3. Adjust the values to your wishes
4. Restart Cinnamon to see the changes (unfortunately, that's necessary)

Known issues
------------
1. Drag-and-Drop (reorder) functionality of the bottom bar might not work
2. Configuration changes require Cinnamon Restart to take effect
